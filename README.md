# 📧 SMS Spam Classifier

A simple **Streamlit web app** that classifies text messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a Machine Learning model trained with TF-IDF and classification algorithms.

---
## 📂 File Structure

app.py - Main Streamlit app file with UI and logic for prediction.  
model.pkl - Trained ML model for SMS spam classification.  
vectorizer.pkl - TF-IDF vectorizer used for transforming input text.  
requirements.txt - List of dependencies for the app (e.g., Streamlit, scikit-learn, nltk).  
README.md - This file 😊.  

## 📈 How It Works

The app processes the entered text message by performing the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Converts the text to lowercase.  
   - Removes punctuation, stopwords, and non-alphanumeric characters.  
   - Applies stemming to reduce words to their root form.  

2. **Vectorization**  
   - Uses the pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`) to convert the cleaned text into numerical features.  

3. **Prediction**  
   - The trained ML model (`model.pkl`) predicts whether the message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  

4. **Result Display**  
   - The app shows the prediction result directly in the Streamlit UI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** – For building the interactive web interface.  
- **Scikit-learn** – For training and saving the machine learning model.  
- **NLTK** – For text preprocessing (stopwords, tokenization, stemming).  
- **Pickle** – For saving and loading the trained model and vectorizer.

## 📊 Model Performance

- The model is trained on a **SMS Spam Collection dataset**.  
- Achieves around **96–98% accuracy** depending on preprocessing and split.  
- Can effectively distinguish between **spam** (ads, fraud, promotional texts) and **ham** (normal messages).

  ## 🚀 Features
- 📝 Input any SMS/Email message  
- ⚡ Instant prediction (Spam / Not Spam)  
- 🎨 Clean and interactive UI with Streamlit  
- 📦 Pre-trained model with TF-IDF + Multinomial Naive Bayes
## 🛠 Installation (Run Locally)

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sms-spam-classifier.git
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

🌐 Deployment
This project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

## 📝 Troubleshooting

- If you encounter **`LookupError: Resource 'stopwords' not found`**, add the following in your `app.py`:
  ```python
  import nltk
  nltk.download('stopwords')
  nltk.download('punkt')
Ensure that both model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl are correctly placed in the project directory.

If deployment on Streamlit Cloud is stuck:
  1. Double-check requirements.txt.
  2. Restart the deployment after clearing cache.
